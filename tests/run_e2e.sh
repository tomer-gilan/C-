# End-to-end test of one C~~ program (codegen-roadmap.md, Step 0d): compiles it with the C~~ compiler, assembles and
# links the .s with gcc, runs the program, and compares its exit status with the one in the program's .exit file.
#
# Usage: tests/run_e2e.sh <compiler> <program.c> <work-dir>
#          compiler:  the c_compiler executable
#          program.c: the test program. Next to it, program.exit holds the expected exit status N (0 <= N <= 255):
#                     the first line that is neither empty nor a "#" comment. The expectation lives outside the
#                     program, so the program needs nothing the compiler might not support yet (such as comments).
#          work-dir:  where the .s and the executable go (kept after the run, for debugging)
# Exit:  0 if the program ran and exited with N; 1 otherwise, with the reason printed.
#
# CTest runs it once per tests/e2e/**/*.c (CMakeLists.txt). Needs gcc and timeout (coreutils). Run it where the tests
# run (the WSL/Ubuntu side).
